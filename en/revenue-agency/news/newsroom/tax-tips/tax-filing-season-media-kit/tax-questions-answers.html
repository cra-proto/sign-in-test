    <h2>COVID-19 and tax-filing</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>1. How will COVID-19 benefit payments affect your 2022 taxes?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
            <p>We have entered a different phase of the pandemic, and the emergency and recovery benefits provided during the COVID-19 pandemic have now ended. </p>
            <p>However, Canadians continued to receive COVID-19 benefit payments in 2022. This means that the CRA will continue to issue T4A slips by the end of February 2023. Residents of Quebec will receive both a T4A and RL-1 slip. If you received COVID-19 benefits in 2022, these are considered taxable income. This means that you will need to enter the total amount you received on your 2022 income tax and benefit return.</p>

            <p>If you made a repayment to the CRA between January 1 and December 31, 2022, for an excess payment received in 2020 or 2021 for any of the following benefits, this amount will be shown in box 201 of your 2022 T4A slip:</p>

            <p>Yes. The CRA encourages everyone to file by April 30, 2023. Since April 30, 2023, falls on a Sunday, your return will be considered filed on time if the CRA receives it, or it is postmarked, on or before Monday, May 1, 2023. This will ensure there are no interruptions to benefit or credit payments and that you avoid late-filing penalties. You can file using the information you have available to estimate the income you received and any income tax withheld from COVID-19 benefit payments. If needed, the CRA will correct the information and send you an amended or cancelled T4A slip. If you receive an amended or cancelled T4A slip, you can request changes to your return if they are required.

            <p>You may also have received a government loan. The loan itself is not taxable. However, any part of the loan that is forgivable is taxable as government assistance in the year you received the loan.</p>

            <p>Those with a modest income and a simple tax situation may be able to use the CRA's <strong>SimpleFile: Let us help you get your benefits!</strong> simplified paper return. These returns are available through Northern Service Centres, band councils offices and Friendship Centres and cannot be downloaded. Individuals are encouraged to check with their local office to get a paper copy. Individuals may be able to use this simplified return if their taxable income is less than the basic income threshold for the province or territory in which they reside. The information provided on the simplified return will help the CRA calculate the Canada child benefit (CCB) and goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax credit (GST/HST credit) for which the individual may be eligible, as well as related provincial and territorial programs.</p>
            <p>If you are unsure about the taxability of your income, we encourage you to consult the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/reporting-income.html">Reporting income</a> web page.</p>

Eligible individuals will receive an invitation letter from the CRA in the mail in February 2023. Follow the steps in the letter to use the service.</p>
            <p>The service is free, secure, and easy-to-use. There are no paper forms to complete or calculations to do. You just have to answer a few automated questions over the phone. At the end of the call, you may receive an estimate of your net income, taxable income, and any refund that you may be eligible for. To receive this information, you will need to provide your personal identification number (PIN) when prompted.

            <p>If you received COVID-19 benefits issued by the CRA or have filed in the past, to avoid delays in receiving your notice of assessment or it going to the wrong address, make sure the CRA has the correct information on file for you. If the CRA does not have your current information, please update it before you file. </p>
            <p>If you are filing returns from before 2017, you will need to file paper returns. These returns can be found on our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years.html">tax packages for all years</a> web page. </p>
               <p>The CRA will charge you a late-filing penalty if you file your 2022 tax return after the due date and you owe tax that remains unpaid at that time.</p> 
            <p>The CRA encourages you to come forward and correct inaccurate or incomplete information, or to disclose information not previously reported through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_taxes-voluntary-disclosures">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a> (VDP).

            <p>If you are living outside Canada, but are considered a Canadian resident for tax purposes and have a Canadian mailing address, we strongly encourage you to file your return online. </p>
            <p>Non-resident Canadians who do not receive their income tax package by February 20, 2023, should download and print the income tax package online at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_my-cra-account&utm_source=txtp&utm_medium=eml&utm_campaign=ttpprflr">canada.ca/taxes-general-package</a>.</p>

The tax usually applies to non-resident, non-Canadian owners. In some situations, however, it also applies to Canadian owners. If you are an <strong>affected owner</strong> of a residential property in Canada on December 31, you must file an UHT return for the calendar year. Even if your ownership of the property qualifies for an exemption and you do not owe any tax, you still must file a return. Services for the UHT will be added in both My Account and My Business Account for those that need to manage taxes on properties within Canada and that do not meet the usage requirements.

            <p>To ensure that Canadians can feel confident using our digital services, we have added some new security measures. These measures include captcha, which helps distinguish between human users and bots when signing in to CRA portals. A captcha requires you to enter specific characters or identify specific images before you can access digital services.</p>
            <p>As well, we have added multi-factor authentication for all users to help make your CRA sign-in services more secure! To ensure everyone can use it, we've introduced a new passcode grid option.

            <p>We have also introduced an optional, additional security measure that allows you to set a unique personal identification number (PIN) for your account so you can identify yourself quickly and securely on the phone with the CRA. You can create your PIN through <a href="/sign-in-test/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_my-cra-account">My Account</a>.</p>
            <p>We also encourage Canadians to help protect their personal information by using a unique and strong password for each online account. Do not reuse the same password for different systems and applications, and regularly monitor all your online accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
            <p>As an additional security measure, all My Account users must have an email address on file. This service notifies you by email if important information, including your address or <a href="/sign-in-test/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">direct deposit</a> information, has been changed on our records.

        <summary>35. What are some of the common mistakes people make on their income tax and benefit return? </summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
            <p>Everyone makes mistakes. If you make a mistake on your income tax and benefit return, it can take longer for us to review your return and prevent you from getting any tax refund, credit or benefit on a timely basis. Mistakes can also lead to a higher chance of a review or an audit of your return.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">To help you avoid mistakes, below is a list of some errors:</h3>
            <p><strong>Not reporting all income</strong> – Make sure you report your income from all sources, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>tips and gratuities</li>
                <li>temporary jobs</li>
                <li>part-time jobs</li>
                <li>income from sales of goods or services if you are carrying on a business (such as side jobs)</li>
                <li>income from the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/platform-economy.html">platform economy</a>, if you are carrying on a business, which includes ridesharing, accommodation sharing, gigs, peer-to-peer sales and social media activities by using digital platforms </li>
                <li>income from online business activities</li>
                <li>foreign income (including interest and other income from investments held outside Canada)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a Canadian resident, you are subject to Canadian income tax on your worldwide income from all sources. You should report all the income you earn (both monetary and non-monetary), whether you receive it in cash or merchandise, or if it's reported as income on your T4 or other tax slips. You should receive most of your slips from your employer, payer, or administrator by the end of February. </p>
            <p>If you have not received a slip or if you have lost or misplaced one, you should ask the issuer for a copy. To avoid delays, you can also view most slips and tax information online through <a href="/sign-in-test/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. Register or sign in before tax season to make sure you have access and your personal information is up to date.</p>
            <p><strong>Not supporting business income and expense claims</strong> – If you're a sole proprietor or self-employed, make sure you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-records.html">keep good records</a> to support your business income and expenses. Reconciling the income recorded in your books to independent sources including bank statements and statements of earnings from other sources, such as digital platforms, can help to ensure the accuracy of your records. If we audit your income tax and benefit return, having good records on hand will make the process faster and easier.</p>
            <p><strong>Not keeping personal information up to date</strong> – It is important to tell us as soon as possible about any change in your address, direct deposit details or marital status (required by law). This helps avoid any disruption to your refund and benefit or credit payments.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal expenses</strong> – You cannot deduct expenses that are personal to you from your income. Examples of these non-deductible amounts include funeral and wedding expenses, loans to family members, and any loss on the sale of personal-use property like a principal residence or an automobile. If we find a mistake or a claim that does not apply to your situation, we will adjust your income tax and benefit return accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>Writing the amount of your partial payment on your paper return</strong> – if you are paying only part of your balance owing, don't write this amount on your paper return. The payment you send with your return will be counted as a payment towards your tax return balance. It will then show as a <strong>payment on filing</strong> on your notice of assessment.</p>
            <p><strong>Filing <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1135.html">Form T1135, Foreign Income Verification Statement</a>, late</strong> – At any time in 2021, if you owned or held specified foreign property and the total cost of all such property was more than CDN$100,000, you have to file Form T1135. Generally, you must file Form T1135 by the due date of your income tax return. A partnership must file Form T1135 by the due date of the partnership information return, even if the income tax return (or the partnership information return) is not required to be filed. </p>
            <p>A late-filing penalty applies if you do not file Form T1135 by the filing due-date. Substantial penalties could apply where such failure is done knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence.</p>
            <p>For more information regarding penalties, see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/foreign-reporting/table-penalties.html">Table of penalties</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are filing Form T1135 electronically, send it separately from your income tax and benefit return. You will receive a confirmation number to confirm we received it.</p>
            <p><strong>If you think you may have made a mistake, see Question 52</strong>. If you are a <strong>small business owner</strong> or <strong>self-employed</strong>, you can get free tax help by booking a virtual visit by phone or videoconference with a Liaison Officer. Liaison Officers can answer your tax-related questions (income, GST/HST, payroll), help you better understand possible business deductions, and show you how to avoid common errors.

        <div class="well well-sm">
            <p>Although owing income tax can be a normal occurrence, it is important to address it without delay. Income tax debt can accrue interest. If you owe money to the CRA but cannot pay your balance when it's due, we still encourage you to file your income tax and benefit return on time.</p>
            <p>We encourage you to contact us if you cannot pay the full amount owed on time. We understand that a tax debt payment could present a significant financial hardship. We can help you find a payment option that will allow you to pay your balance owing over time. The CRA charges interest on what you owe until your balance is paid.
