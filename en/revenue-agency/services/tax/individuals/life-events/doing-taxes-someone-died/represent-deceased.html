        <h2 id="h_1">Determine who is representing the person who died</h2>
<p>When someone dies, the legal representative is responsible for the administration of the estate of the person who died. Generally, an estate is what the person who died owned (assets) and what they owe (liabilities). Some costs and liabilities, including any balances owing to the CRA, are paid out of the assets of the estate. The legal representative may be assisted in the administration of an estate by an authorized representative.</p>
<h3 id="h_1a">Types of representatives</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Legal representative</dt> <dd><p>The legal representative is typically the executor named in the will who will settle the estate. The responsibilities of the legal representative include making sure that tax returns are filed and any balances owing to the CRA are resolved.</p>
<p>In Québec, you are the legal representative if you are registered as the liquidator of the estate and may have additional administrative duties. Visit Revenu Québec's <a href="">steps to follow after a death</a> for this information.</p>
<p>If you are the legal representative, you must <a href="#h_3">notify the CRA that you are the legal representative</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#h_1b">Find out what to do if there is no will or executor</a>.</p>
</dd> <dt>Authorized representative</dt> <dd><p>An authorized representative is someone, such as an accountant or a lawyer, who can view, get information about, and update the tax information for individuals, businesses or trusts.</p>
<h4>Authorize a representative</h4>
<p>The legal representative can appoint one or more authorized representatives to manage the tax information on their behalf.</p>

<h3 id="h_1b">If there is no will or executor</h3>
<p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), or an executor has not been named in a will, certain individuals can apply through the courts to administer the estate. Check with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/named-attorney/resources-estate-law.html">estate law of the provincial or territorial government</a> of the residence of the person who died for more information.</p>
<p>If there is no court-appointed representative or you are waiting for an appointment from the court, you can request to be appointed as a representative for CRA matters by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc552.html">Form RC552, Appointing a Representative for a Deceased Person</a> and mailing it to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a> of the person who died.</p>
<p>Once your request has been approved, you will be authorized as a representative who can view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. This approval is for CRA purposes only and not for other administrative responsibilities outside the CRA.</p>

<p>As the legal representative, you can also authorize additional representatives, such as accountants or lawyers, and grant them access to the tax records of the person who died.</p>
<h3>For online access to tax records</h3>
<p>There are 3 ways to authorize online access to additional representatives:</p>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><details><summary>The legal representative adds an additional representative from their Represent a Client</summary><ol>
<li>In <a href="/sign-in-test/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>, enter the SIN of the person who died to access their online tax account</li>
<li>In the 'Related services section', select 'Authorized representative(s)'</li>
<li>Select ‘Authorize a new representative' and follow the instructions to add one or more additional representatives<ul>
<li>You will need the authorized representative's RepID, Business number or GroupID</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you complete the steps to add them, you will receive a confirmation and they will have immediate online and offline access to the account</li>
</ol>
</details> <details><summary>The additional representative submits an authorization request through EFILE</summary><p>The additional representative must be a registered electronic filer in good standing. EFILE must be used with CRA certified professional tax software.</p>
<p>When the additional representative submits a request through EFILE, the authorization request generates a signature page that needs to be printed by the additional representative and signed by the legal representative. The additional representative:</p>
<ul>
<li>should keep this signed signature page for their records</li>
<li>should <strong>not</strong> send this signed signature page to the CRA unless requested<ul>
<li>if the signature page is sent to the CRA without being requested, it will <strong>not</strong> be processed or returned</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li>The additional representative will need to submit the signed signature page using the “Submit documents” service in their Represent a Client account<ul>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> mail or fax a copy of the signature page to the CRA, as it will not be processed nor returned to you</li>
