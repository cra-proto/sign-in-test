    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Option 1</dt>
    <dd><strong>Use a different sign in method:</strong><br>

    </dd>
    <dt>Option 2</dt>
    <dd><strong>Register for a new CRA user ID:</strong><br>
    <p>You may need to Contact us to register for a new CRA user ID and password. When registering, ensure that your user ID is unique to your CRA account. To help avoid having your CRA user ID and password revoked in the future, your new user ID and password <strong>should not</strong>:</p>

     <li>Be similar to one that was previously revoked</li>
     <li>Contain any parts of your name</li>
   </ul>
      <p>Once registered, the CRA will mail you a security code to give you full access to online services.
